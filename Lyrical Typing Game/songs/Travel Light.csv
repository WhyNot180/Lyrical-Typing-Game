close the window and your eyes, 16
disappear into the blue, 20
wrap your fingers around the great escape, 28
drinking moonshine on the moon, 33
got you feelin' like a queen, 38

looking down on those travelling lights, 46

best be on my way, 75
loading down that moving sidewalk, 80
I go clear right and calm, 85
don't want the fruit from that still life, 93
